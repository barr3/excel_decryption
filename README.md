# Setup
Run the file `setup.py` to setup the environmental variables correctly. Do load the environmental variables correctly, reload the terminal, or run `source ~/.bashrc` or `source ~/.zshrc`, depending on the shell used.

# Running the script
Type `python3 filescript.py &` (the & is used to run the script detached).
